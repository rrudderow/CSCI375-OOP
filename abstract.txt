We are planning to create an inventory management system that allows the user to add and 
subtract items and keeps track of how many items have been sold. The program will allow for 
location data to be kept and updated as product is shipped around. Each item will contain its 
current location and whether it will be moved. Location data will be an attribute of the product. 
The program will be able to tell the user how many of each product are at each location.
