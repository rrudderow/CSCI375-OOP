Project Title: Warehouses System

Our project is a system of warehouses. The user can add warehouses to the system, and create items
in those warehouses. Items can be added, removed, or moved between different warehouses as the user
wishes. Our program accurately tracks the locations and states of every item in each warehouse, and 
uses Singleton, Observer, and Iterator design patterns to ensure that all activity is enclosed in
a single system, manipulated without duplication or other errors, and that each item is listed
correctly, and the counts of each item in a warehouse are dynamically tracked.
